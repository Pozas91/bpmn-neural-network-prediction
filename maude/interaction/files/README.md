# Formal Modelling and Analysis of BPMN processes using Maude
# authors: Francisco Duran, Camilo Rocha, Gwen Salaun, and Nicolas Pozas

I cannot make the interaction work using files. In Maude, files can be used to read them from the begining, but there is no way to wait until the file is ready to read from it. I haven't found the way to work out the interaction between the processes using files. 

We have moved to using sockets instead.
